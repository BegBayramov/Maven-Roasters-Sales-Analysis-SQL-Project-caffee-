# Maven-Roasters-Sales-Analysis-SQL-Project-caffee-
This project analyzes transactional sales data from Maven Roasters, a fictional coffee shop with multiple locations. 
The goal of the analysis is to explore sales performance, customer behavior, and product insights using SQL. 

🗂 Dataset

The dataset contains:
--transaction date & time
--store location
--product details
--quantity sold
--unit price 

🧹 Data Cleaning

The raw dataset required several cleaning steps before analysis:

Converted text fields to proper data types
Standardized date and time formats
Replaced comma decimal separators in prices
Removed empty and invalid records
Created a calculated revenue column
This process simulates a real-world ETL workflow.
